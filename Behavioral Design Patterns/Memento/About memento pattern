Intent:

Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be stored to this state later

Also known as : Token

Use the Memento pattern when:
  
  -> a snapshot of (some portion of) an object's state must be saved so that it can be restored to that state later, and
  
  -> a direct interface to obtaining the state would expose implementation details and break the object's encapsulation

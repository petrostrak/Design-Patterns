Creational Pattern

Creational design patterns abstract the instatiation process. They help make a system independent of
how its objects are created, composed and represented. A class creational pattern uses inheritance to
vary the class that's instantiated, whereas an object creational pattern will delegate instantiation
to another object. 

Creational patterns become important as systems evolve to depend more on object composition than class
inheritance. As that happens, emphasis shifs away from hard-coding a fixed set of behaviors toward defining
a smaller set of fundamental behaviors that can be composed into any number of more complex ones. Thus
creating objects with particular behaviors requires more than simply instantiating a class.

There are two recurring themes in these patterns. First, they all encapsulate knowledge about which concrete
classes the system uses.Second, they hide how instances of these classes are created and put together. All 
the system at large knows about the objects is their interfaces as defined by abstract classes.

Consequently, the creational patterns give you a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it,
how it gets created and when.

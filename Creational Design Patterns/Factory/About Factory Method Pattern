Intent:

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory
Method lets a class defer instantioation to subclasses.

Also Known As: Virtual Constructor

Use the Factory Method pattern when
  
  -> a class can't anticipate the class of objectsit must create
  
  -> a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates
  
  -> classes delegate repsonsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want to localize the knowledge
     of which helper subclass is the delegate.

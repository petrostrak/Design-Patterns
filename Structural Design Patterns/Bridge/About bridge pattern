Intent:

Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

Also known as: Handle / Boby

Use the Bridge pattern when

  -> you want to avoid a permanent biding between an abstraction and its implementation. This might be the case
     for example, when the implementation must be selected or switched at run-time.
     
  -> both the abstraction and their implementations should be extensible by subclassig. In this case, the Bridge
     pattern lets you combine the different abstractions and implementations and extend them independently.
     
  -> changes in the implementation of an abstraction should have no impaxt on clients; that is, their code should
     not haveto be recompiled.
     
  ->

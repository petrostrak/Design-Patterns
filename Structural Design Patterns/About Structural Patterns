Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations. As a simple example,
consider how multiple inheritance mixes two or more classes into one. The result is a class that combines
the properties of its parent classes. This pattern is particularly useful for making independently developed
class libraries work together.

Rather than composing interfaces or implementations, structural  object patterns describe ways to compose
objects to realize new functionality. The added flexibility of object composition comes from the ability to 
change the composition at run-time, which is impossible with static class composition.

Intent: 

Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

The Flyweight pattern's effectiveness depends heavily on how and where it's used. Apply the Flyweight pattern 
when all of the following are true:

  -> An application uses a large number of objects
  
  -> Storage costs are high because of the sheer quantity of objects
  
  -> Most object state can be made extrinsic
  
  -> Many groups of objects may be replaced by relatively few shared objects once extrinsic state is removed
  
  -> The application doesn't depend on oject identity. Since flyweight objects may be shared, identity tests
     will return true for conceptually distinct objects.
